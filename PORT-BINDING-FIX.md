How It Works Now — Malik's Determination Cycle

Clear previous tokens

Attempt port 8888

If busy → try 8080

If busy → try 9999

If busy → switch to random available port

Retry up to 3 times if binding fails

Succeed once a port is found

Retry Logic

Binding errors → retry

Config/network/permission errors → skip retry and show helpful message

What’s Fixed — Saitama’s One-Hit Solution

Port binding conflicts fully resolved

Automatic fallback implemented

Random port selection as a last resort

Smart error messages for different failure types

Google account switching remains functional

Test Results — Tanjiro’s Training Arc

Before Fix

Address already in use: bind

OAuth failed entirely

No retry or fallback

After Fix

Detects conflict instantly

Tries alternative ports automatically

Uses random port if all fail

OAuth completes successfully

Updated Package — Bulma’s Engineering Upgrade

File: GPATracker-PORT-FIXED.zip (38.21 MB)
Includes:

Robust port fallback logic

Retry & recovery system

Enhanced error handling

All previous features intact

How to Use — Luffy’s Simple Plan

Click “Sign in with Google.”

App tries port 8888 → 8080 → 9999 → random.

Browser opens automatically.

Sign in — OAuth completes normally.

No manual port configuration required.

Technical Details — Shikamaru’s Strategy Notes

Port Strategy

Port	Purpose
8888	Standard Google OAuth port
8080	Common web fallback
9999	High, rarely used port
0	Random system-assigned port

Retry Logic

3 attempts maximum

1-second delay between tries

Different port per attempt

Full logging for troubleshooting

Status

Port Binding: Stable and conflict-free

Google OAuth: Fully functional
