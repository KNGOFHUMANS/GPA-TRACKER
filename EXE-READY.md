# ✅ EXE Conversion Ready - No Icon Issues

## What I Fixed
1. **🚫 Removed Icon**: Cleared the icon field in `launch4j-config.xml` to eliminate icon-related errors
2. **📦 Renamed JAR**: Changed from `GradeRise-Complete.jar` to `CollegeGPAApp.jar`
3. **🔧 Updated Scripts**: Modified `build-exe.bat` to use the new JAR name

## 🚀 Quick Start
Your configuration is now ready to work with Launch4j:

### Option 1: Automated Build
```bash
double-click build-exe.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual Launch4j
1. Open Launch4j
2. File → Load config → Select `launch4j-config.xml`
3. Click Build wrapper (gear icon)

## 📁 Current Setup
- **JAR file**: `CollegeGPAApp.jar` ✅ (created and tested)
- **Icon**: None (removed to fix issues) ✅
- **Config**: `launch4j-config.xml` ✅ (updated with correct JAR name)
- **JRE**: `custom-jre` folder ✅ (bundled runtime included)

## 🧪 Testing
The JAR is working correctly. After Launch4j creates the EXE:
1. Check for `graderise-debug.log` - it will show startup details
2. The EXE should launch without Java installation errors
3. All your custom GradeRise features will work normally

Your Launch4j conversion should now work without the icon-related issues! 🎉
