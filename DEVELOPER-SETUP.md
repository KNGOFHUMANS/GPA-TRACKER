# Developer Setup Instructions

## 🔑 OAuth Credentials Setup

This project uses a secure credential management approach:

### For New Developers:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KNGOFHUMANS/GPA-TRACKER.git
   cd GPA-TRACKER
   ```

2. **Copy the template:**
   ```bash
   copy client_secret.json.template client_secret.json
   ```

3. **Set up your Google OAuth credentials:**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a project and enable Google+ API
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop application)
   - Download the JSON file and replace the content in `client_secret.json`

4. **Your `client_secret.json` is automatically ignored by git** - your credentials stay private!

### For the Project Owner (Current Workflow):

✅ **Your Local Setup:**
- You have actual OAuth credentials in `client_secret.json`
- The app works perfectly with Google Sign-In
- Your credentials are ignored by git (never committed)

✅ **When You Push to GitHub:**
- Only the template (`client_secret.json.template`) is committed
- Other developers get the template and set up their own credentials
- Your actual credentials remain private and secure

### File Security:
```
client_secret.json.template  ← Committed (template values)
client_secret.json          ← Ignored by git (your actual credentials)
```

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

1. **Make your changes** with your actual credentials working locally
2. **Commit and push** - only the template goes to GitHub
3. **Other developers** clone and set up their own credentials from the template

This ensures:
- ✅ Your app works perfectly locally
- ✅ Your credentials stay private
- ✅ Other developers can easily set up their own
- ✅ No credential security issues

## 🚀 Current Status

All major issues have been resolved:
- Login UI professional dark theme
- Google OAuth with multi-port fallback
- Account switching functionality
- Comprehensive error handling
- Port conflict resolution
- OAuth credential validation

The application is ready for production use!
